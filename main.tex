Grading Rubrics 

To pass this class you will need a passing grade of 60%. This should be pretty doable as you will be mostly graded on:
   
Attendance
30%
Cooking/ Lab Work
40%
Reflections
20%
Participation/ Team Work
10%
 
Attendance: The attendance grade is based on how many classes you attend. Every class you will be given a cod that you have to input in a Google Form so we will know if you came to class! You have 1 unexcused absence after which  your attendance grade will decrease by a letter grade.

Cooking/ Lab Work: This grade will be mostly based on the amount of effort and attentiveness you show during lab. Maintaining a clean workspace and leaving with a clean space will also be 50% of this grade. Even though we hope that everyone will be able to leave with a well-made dish we know that his may not always be possible so this will only count towards 20% of the cooking grade.

Reflections: Your reflections will be graded for accuracy and including information contained in readings as well as discussed during class.

Participation/Team Work: Teamwork during Cooking Labs as well and asking/answering questions during class will constitute most of this grade.
