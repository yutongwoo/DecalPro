\section{Grading Rubrics} 


To pass this class you will need a passing grade of 60\%. This should be pretty doable as you will be graded on:

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{lll}
 Attendance &  30\% \\
 Cooking/ Lab Work & 40\%  \\
 Reflections &  20\%  \\
 Participation & 10\% \\ 
\end{tabular}
\end{table}   

Below, each of the categories is explained in detail:
\subsection{Attendance}
 The attendance grade is based on how many classes you attend. Every class you will be given a cod that you have to input in a Google Form so we will know if you came to class! You have 1 unexcused absence after which  your attendance grade will decrease by a letter grade.

\subsection{Cooking/ Lab Work} This grade will be mostly based on the amount of effort and attentiveness you show during lab. Maintaining a clean workspace and leaving with a clean space will also be 50\% of this grade. Even though we hope that everyone will be able to leave with a well-made dish we know that his may not always be possible so this will only count towards 20\% of the cooking grade.

\subsection{Reflections} Your reflections will be graded for accuracy and including information contained in readings as well as discussed during class.

\subsection{Participation/Team Work} Teamwork during Cooking Labs as well and asking/answering questions during class will constitute most of this grade.
